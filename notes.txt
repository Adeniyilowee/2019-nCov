Coronavirus Competition by Sage Health.
Objective: Find a candidate drug (ligand) with a high binding affinity with the 2019-COVID main protease. A few studies have shown that HIV antivirals offer promising results, but this is still an open field of discovery. Use machine learning to identify a potential candidate, then use docking software to get the binding affinity between it and the main protease. Write a report that describes your process and results in detail in the form of a jupyter notebook. Finding a new drug or validating an existing drug are both suitable approaches, we will be donating samples of the winning compound to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for further analysis.

PDB structure code: 6LU7
	-Unpublished. Coronavirus protease with docked ligand.

Docked N3 ligand. Peptide-like. Smiles:
CC(C)C[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@H](C)NC(=O)c1cc(C)on1)C(C)C)C(=O)N[C@@H](C[C@@H]2CCNC2=O)\C=C/C(=O)OCc3ccccc3

Possible approaches:
	Homology studies on similar protease proteins, possibly with more ligands bound.
	3D shape-filling studies on the molecule?

Workflow:
	-95 pdb entries share 96% homology to the coronavirus structure.
				99% identity to Bat Coronavirus
		-PDB for 6LU7, sequence similarity
	-Search the pubchem bioassay database to get the structures of ligands bound, and their activities
	-query: "P0C6X7"[UniProt Accession] AND (pcassay_pccompound_active[filt]) AND (pcassay_pccompound_activityconcnanomolar[filt]) 
	-Ensures active compounds. Maybe be able to design a workflow that can actually grab these structures?

Details of N3 inhibitor:
	Peptide-like (5/6-mer)
	Covalent micheal acceptor subject to nuc attack to CYS145 on the protein
	
	Interactions mapped out. Not the same as N3 in CovNL63, shown in that paper. a hydrogen bond between the =O of the O-Benzyl group cannot accept a hydrogen bond from a nearby glycine (G142 in the NL63) this means that there’s an additional degree of freedom surrounding that benzyl group, maybe enough room to change to O-Benzyl to a heterocycle and have an h-bond form between it and Threonine 26. Found another possible binding spot with a leucine on the ligand to His41 on the protein.

Found 3 possible new sites for bonds.
New spots for cyclization within the molecule.

How to move forward
	-Autodock Vina, re-dock this molecule.
	-Selective atom changes, re-dock. Try to add 1 stable extra interaction, for slightly higher score. 

	-Try other docking programs (some using ML) to get a better score

	-Do any docking programs model covalent inhibition? very important!
		-not as important :/

	-Get ligands from other, homologous structures. Might be able to build a small dataset from that.

Pubchem assay ID’s for SARS main protease
search: (SARS coronavirus AND (73745819[ProteinTargetGI])) 
73745819[ProteinTargetGI] - GI of protein target for 3C-like protease, partial [Infectious bronchitis virus] - 95.25% identity with the structure of 2019-nCov (insilico)
2GTB, 4MDS, both pdb structures of SARS main protease, latter with non-covalent inhibitors

AID’s for 73745819[ProteinTargetGI] - see file


Trying to find more protease inhibitor data.

Downloaded the fasta file of the nCov main protease.
Blast search finds the exact sequence as a polyprotein (this protein is translated as a large polyprotein, then cleaves itself. There are very many matches and a lot of similarity between them - many different mutants of the SARS coronavirus.

To find more Assays using similar proteins, might be better to search similarity on the PDB. Need to find Various other relevant proteases.

Done:
SARS - GI73745819
HIV - GI75593047 - pol polyprotein
Hep3 NSC - No specific protein target, just searched NS3 in protein target text. Also some west nile virus in there?
MERS - No specific target, just searched MERS Protease in pubchem search bar. So few results that I can look at them individually. All mention 3CL-Pro by name except the last one (removed manually)

Using NCBI PUG-REST
https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug-rest-tutorial$_Toc458584429

https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/assay/aid/XXXX/csv
to get AID’s

https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/substance/sid/XXXX/sdf
https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/cid/XXXX/sdf
to get structures

What can I add to this approach that is unique?
	-Pairwise compound comparison?
	-Dock all the structures then use docking score as the target?
		using 2 machine and at 5 mins/compound, we’re looking at 4.34 days to dock 2500 structures.
	-In-pocket design. Manually? 

TODO going forward:
	Get more Assay ID’s
	Get Structures + format them into a good little database (medchem filters?)
	Re-Dock the N3 ligand.
	Download a generation framework and get it working - using the database


Ok, now searching for “Protease” in protein search. The probably is there is like 50,000+ entries for each virus because there are so many mutants and replicates.


More viruses? - Did blast with keeping 5000 sequences this time and still got many different coronaviruses. Interesting, but I want similar viruses that will actually have some assays against them.

Searched for west nile virus: found AID: 577, HTS to identify Inhibitors of West Nile Virus NS2bNS3 Proteinase, with a massive 65K compounds tested. AID: 653 looks to be the follow-up, with fewer tests. Might be better to just grab the compounds from AID 653 because they look to be less shotgun-blasts than the others

Worked on the notebook that will download ready the inhibitor datasets. Uses PUG-REST and python's os import.

Re-docking the N3 ligand in the crystal structure of the protein.
	First, open the .cif file and save as .pdb. The delete the covalent n3 inhibitor and save the receptor as a .pdb. The do the same and save the ligand as a pdb aswell.

Gridbox around the receptor (might not be perfect):

center: x=-10.963, x=12.683, z=67.193
num points in x: 28, y=40, z=32, spacing .5

Docking with a completely rigid protein for the first time only.

For future reference, to make felixble ligands, init file will look like:

******************

receptor = your_receptor_noflex.pdbqt
flex = your_flexes.pdbqt
ligand = your_ligand.pdbqt

out = out.pdbqt

center_x = 2.9
center_y = -7.1
center_z = 0.8

size_x = 12
size_y = 18
size_z = 12

exhaustiveness = 8

*************************

following Oleg's tutorial again.

run vina using ./vina --config conf.txt

Re-docked in vina - out.pdbqt. structure is not the same as the one found in the orignal N3 ligand, because this is not a covalent inhibitor. Value to beat now is -7.5 kcal/mol

Now is time to find a generative process to get up and running. I predict this will prbably take the post time to get meaningful results from, so might aswell start now without the dataset full downloaded.

Re-docked the N3 Ligand in Vina again, but this time using golem and ramping exhaustiveness up to 100, using all 80 cpus. Took about the same time as the workstations ones doing exhautivness 20.
The new highest docking score is -7.6 kcal/mol. flexible ligands may get this higher because it can fit better into the binding pocket.
