Coronavirus Competition by Sage Health.
Objective: Find a candidate drug (ligand) with a high binding affinity with the 2019-COVID main protease. A few studies have shown that HIV antivirals offer promising results, but this is still an open field of discovery. Use machine learning to identify a potential candidate, then use docking software to get the binding affinity between it and the main protease. Write a report that describes your process and results in detail in the form of a jupyter notebook. Finding a new drug or validating an existing drug are both suitable approaches, we will be donating samples of the winning compound to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for further analysis.

PDB structure code: 6LU7
	-Unpublished. Coronavirus protease with docked ligand.

Docked N3 ligand. Peptide-like. Smiles:
CC(C)C[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@H](C)NC(=O)c1cc(C)on1)C(C)C)C(=O)N[C@@H](C[C@@H]2CCNC2=O)\C=C/C(=O)OCc3ccccc3

Possible approaches:
	Homology studies on similar protease proteins, possibly with more ligands bound.
	3D shape-filling studies on the molecule?

Workflow:
	-95 pdb entries share 96% homology to the coronavirus structure.
		-PDB for 6LU7, sequence similarity
	-Search the pubchem bioassay database to get the structures of ligands bound, and their activities
	-query: "P0C6X7"[UniProt Accession] AND (pcassay_pccompound_active[filt]) AND (pcassay_pccompound_activityconcnanomolar[filt]) 
	-Ensures active compounds. Maybe be able to design a workflow that can actually grab these structures?

Details of N3 inhibitor:
	Peptide-like (5/6-mer)
	Covalent micheal acceptor subject to nuc attack to CYS145 on the protein
	
	Interactions mapped out. Not the same as N3 in CovNL63, shown in that paper. a hydrogen bond between the =O of the O-Benzyl group cannot accept a hydrogen bond from a nearby glycine (G142 in the NL63) this means that thereâ€™s an additional degree of freedom surrounding that benzyl group, maybe enough room to change to O-Benzyl to a heterocycle and have an h-bond form between it and Threonine 26. Found another possible binding spot with a leucine on the ligand to His41 on the protein.

Found 3 possible new sites for bonds.
New spots for cyclization within the molecule.

How to move forward
	-Autodock Vina, re-dock this molecule.
	-Selective atom changes, re-dock. Try to add 1 stable extra interaction, for slightly higher score. 

	-Try other docking programs (some using ML) to get a better score

	-Do any docking programs model covalent inhibition? very important!

	-Get ligands from other, homologous structures. Might be able to build a small dataset from that.
